# Dave and Fred are members of a dancing club in which no member can 
# both  waltz  and jive.   Fred"s dad can"t waltz and  Dave  can  do 
# whatever  fred can"t do.  If a child can do something, then their 
# parents can do it also.
#
#Prove that there is a member of the dancing club who can"t jive.
